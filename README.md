### Towards Automated Data Intelligence: 
### An End-to-End Analytical Pipeline on Google Cloud using Apache Spark and BigQuery

In todayâ€™s digital world, companies collect large amounts of data from many sources, but turning this data into useful information is still a big challenge. This project focuses on building a complete data analytics pipeline that can take raw data, process it efficiently, and deliver meaningful insights. The solution uses Apache Spark, BigQuery for handling big data and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to manage and scale the system.
Traditional systems often struggle to keep up with the volume and speed of modern data. They can be slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. Apache Spark and BigQuery are powerful tools that can process data quickly by dividing the work across multiple computers. GCP offers cloud-based tools that make it easier to store, process, and analyse data without needing to manage hardware.
In this project, I will build a step-by-step system that collects data from different sources (such as sensors, files, and APIs), cleans and processes the data using Spark and BigQuery, and stores it in the cloud. Then, I will use analytics tools to turn the data into reports or dashboards that help users make decisions.
This pipeline is designed to work with both batch data (data collected over time) and real-time data (data coming in constantly). It will be tested for speed, reliability, and cost to make sure it is practical for real-world use.
The final goal is to create a working model that shows how big data tools and cloud services can be used together to solve real problems. This will not only help companies handle their data better but also provide a useful example for others working in the field of data science.
